% --------------------------
% |(-1,1)    (0,1)    (1,1)|

% |(-1,0)    (0,0)    (1,0)|

% |(-1,-1)   (0,-1)  (1,-1)|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Signature line  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% One can add a signature image in a PDF file using the following code; this requires a file called "signature_block.pdf" to be installed in the same folder as the .tex file.  The vertical spacing (\vspace) and the scaling will have to be adjusted to get things to look correct for your particular signature image. Alternatively, comment out the following line in favor of the one labeled "[[Alternate]]" if you want to sign a paper copy of the letter.

\signature{ 
\vspace{-12mm}\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{assets/signature.pdf}\\\vspace{-2mm}
\name}
% \signature{\name}  % [[Alternate]]

% This block sets up the address on the right-hand side of the header.
% The following lines just compile the information you set up into the LaTex letter variable "address" for later use.
% The following command "clears out" the default address so that it can be better set using \tikz
\address{}

\def\newaddress{
\Where\\ 
\Address\\ 
\CityZip\\ 
\TEL\\ 
% \Email\\ 
\URL }

%%%%%%%%%%%  DATE  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If you want a date different from the current date, comment out the next line in favor of the line labeled "[[Alternate]]".  The ``\vspace{10mm}'' just moves the date down a tiny bit so it doesn't interfere with the header.  This can be adjusted to your preference.
\date{\vspace{10mm} \today}
%\date{\vspace{10mm} 20 September 2020}  %[[Alternate]]

               Recipient School Address}

% This line sets up the return address to the right-side of the OSU logo.  The location is set with absolute node addresses using ``\tikz''.  It can still be a bit fussy, and you may need to alter this a little to get things to look right.  The bit that changes the position are the numbers in parentheses ``at (14.2,2.7)''
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay,every node/.style={anchor=center}]
\node[text width=6cm] at (page cs:0.5, 0.73){\small \newaddress};
\end{tikzpicture} 

%%%%%%  The ``opening'' is just the method of address you would like to use at the start of the letter.
\opening{Dear Application Committee,}

%%%%%%%%%% Body of letter   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remove it if you do not want watermark
\watermark{}{}{}

% The ``\lipsum[1-8]" command just fills the letter with 8 paragraphs of Latin for the purposes of filler.  Unless you really want to send filler Latin to someone, you will replace this command with actual text.  Do that here:
\lipsum[1-8]

%%%%%%% ``closing'' sets the sign-off line.
\closing{Sincerely,}

%\encl{If an enclosure is provided, let them know what it is.}
